### Project [MPP]: Idea Generation for Price Prediction Signal for a Macro Asset or ETF

* Objective: Conceptualize a novel price prediction signal for a chosen macro asset or broad-based index
ETF.

  * This project focuses on idea generation, understanding the underlying rationale, and
potential data-driven insights that could back up the proposed signal. While the main emphasis
is on the conceptual framework, implementation or preliminary testing is a valuable addition.

  * Begin by selecting a major macro asset or broad-based index ETF of interest. Based on your
research, conceptualize a potential price prediction signal. This could be rooted in technical
analysis, fundamental analysis, or any unconventional sources or patterns you've identified.
Articulate the reasoning behind your proposed signal. Why do you believe it might have
predictive power? Are there any historical events or data-driven insights that might support your
idea?

  * Detail your thought process in conceptualizing the signal, the research conducted, and the
rationale behind its potential effectiveness. If you opted for preliminary testing, discuss your
data, findings and the implications they might have for the feasibility of your signal.
